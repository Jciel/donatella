# Donatella

Donatella is a simple project with the purpose of serving as initial artifact with resources for projects based in Node.JS.

#### Usage

The main goal is to disseminate examples to beginning developers. 

With this you can:
- View examples of running features;
- Understand and use in their development;
- Build cool things out of it;
- And most importantly, if possible, share this with others.
